# Multi-Lingual Hate Speech Detection

We used multi-lingual hate speech dataset called OLID and applied various transformer models to identify the best approach for detecting hate speech across many languages. We have used a multi-lingual transformer model called XLM-RoBeRTa, and we have also used BeRT models pretrained specfically on individual languages. Some examples of our analysis are included in the figure below.
